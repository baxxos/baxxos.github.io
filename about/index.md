# About this website
This website was originally created as a school assignment - a static page to serve as an online CV overview, developer portfolio or blog later.
The main goal was to get familiar with an advanced way to create static websites - use GitHub Pages enhanced by Jekyll and use Markdown for writing
the actual content. Whole idea of the page is based on [this](https://www.google.com "Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub") tutorial by _Jonathan McGlone_ which I followed step-by-step first and later customized it according to my needs.

## Architecture
* HTML5, CSS3 (Sass) and [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the looks
* [OpenColor](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) for the color scheme
* [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for writing the content
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for serving the content
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for publishing and hosting

# About me
My real name is _Michal Mel√∫ch_ and I do all sorts of programming stuff. However, most of the time I like to play around with websites - anything from colors, layout or design to the UX improvements. Currently I'm still studying - I'm in my final year of bachelor's studies at the [Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies](http://www.fiit.stuba.sk/) (Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava). In the futue, I'd like to focus on improving the overall usability of websites and applications in general. In my spare time, I like to ~~_do nothing as I have no spare time_~~ go for a drive, play a game of basketball or browse dank memes.
