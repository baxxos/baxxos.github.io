# About this website
This website was originally created as a school assignment - a static page to serve as an online CV overview, developer portfolio or blog later.
The main goal was to get familiar with an advanced way to create static websites - use GitHub Pages enhanced by Jekyll and use Markdown for writing
the actual content. Whole idea of the page is based on [this](https://www.google.com "Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub") tutorial by _Jonathan McGlone_ which I followed step-by-step first and later customized it according to my needs.

## Architecture
* HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 3 for the looks
* OpenColor for the colors
* Markdown for writing the content
* Jekyll for serving the content
* GitHub Pages for publishing and hosting
