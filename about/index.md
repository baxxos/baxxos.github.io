# About this website

This website was originally created as a school assignment - a static page to serve as an online CV overview, developer portfolio or personal blog.
The main goal was to get familiar with more advanced ways to create static websites and utilize GitHub Pages for hosting the content.

The whole idea of this page is based on [this](https://www.google.com "Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub") tutorial by _Jonathan McGlone_ which I later customized to according to my needs. The tech stack has already become a bit dated since its first launch (looking at you, jQuery), but why change something that works?

## Architecture

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for serving the content
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for publishing and free hosting
- HTML5, CSS3 (Sass) and [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the looks
- [OpenColor](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) for the color scheme
- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for writing the content

# About me

My name is _Michal Mel√∫ch_ and I do all sorts of programming stuff. However, most of the time I like to play around with web apps - i. e. coding application logic, designing layouts or ensuring app usability.

I'm not studying anymore - I've graduated from the [Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies](http://www.fiit.stuba.sk/) (Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava) as an software engineer in 2019. The work I do profesionally is usually frontend-related, however, I aim to gradually transition to fullstack development. In my spare time, I like to ~~_do nothing as I have no spare time_~~ go for a drive, play a game of basketball or just browse memes.

If you're interested in my work, found a bug on this website or just want to leave a random message, please feel free to use any of the contact channels listed at the bottom of this page.
