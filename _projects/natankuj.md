A desktop clone of the local Slovak web application monitoring current fuel costs called ["Natankuj"](http://auto.sme.sk/natankuj/) but with some added functionality such as graphs and direct HTML price parsing from the original website. The real challenge was that the application had to be written as a JavaEE project using technologies such as Glassfish (application server), Hiberante (ORM), JavaFX (GUI) and PostgreSQL (persistance).
