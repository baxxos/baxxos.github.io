This application is currently still under development since it represents the assignment of my Bachelor thesis. However, the main idea is to provide a simple way to compare and evaluate eye-tracking data captured by [Tobii](http://www.tobiipro.com/) eye-tracking devices which are widely used in UX research. It features Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, HTML Canvas, AngularJS and various other JavaScript libraries.
