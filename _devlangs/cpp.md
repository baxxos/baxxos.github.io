When I first started to do some programming at the university, C was the only language we used for almost 2 years. Later on it got replaced
by Java due to its OOP nature, better GUI support (JavaFX) and native SQL libraries. However, I still appreciate the
effectivness and low-level access provided by C. I also got briefly in touch with C++ as it was a requirement for 
some of the subjects I've taken during my studies.
