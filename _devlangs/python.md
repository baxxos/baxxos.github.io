I've used Python for the first time during the work on my Bachelor thesis and I felt comfortable with it almost instantly (v2.7.X combined with _Flask_). I love the fact that the language itself forces me to write clean code and that people are always looking for the most 'Pythonic' way of doing a thing instead of
hacking their way around. Also, there is a huge collection of third party libraries ready to be imported almost instantly into any project.
