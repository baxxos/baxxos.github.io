JavaScript is pretty much a neccessity when it comes to any web application. However, there are literally thousands of more or less useful
frameworks and libraries available and the choosing proper one proved to be a challenge for me. So far I've done some work in _jQuery_ and _AngularJS 1.X_
but I'll probably move to _Angular 2/React/Vue.js_ in the future. Also, I don't like the fact that the language itself is very weakly typed and debugging turns out to be a nightmare in some cases. Therefore I'm looking forward to trying out _TypeScript_ in my next project(s).
