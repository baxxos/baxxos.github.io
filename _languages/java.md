Java was the first truly object-oriented programming language I've ever used. Also, it was the first language I've used to create a graphical
interface of some sort. I really like how well the language is documented, how easy it is to write and debug and how straightforward it feels. 
However, after doing some work in Python and C++ I think that Java is better suited for big enterprise applications (e.g. Java EE) than personal projects.
